# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

I have obtained this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data

## This is the decription of the dataset -

The dataset is comprised of tab-separated files with phrases from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Each Sentence has been parsed into many phrases by the Stanford parser. Each phrase has a PhraseId. Each sentence has a SentenceId. Phrases that are repeated (such as short/common words) are only included once in the data.

train.tsv contains the phrases and their associated sentiment labels. They have additionally provided a SentenceId so that you can track which phrases belong to a single sentence.
The sentiment labels are:

0 - negative
1 - somewhat negative
2 - neutral
3 - somewhat positive
4 - positive
